# No name (How long is a while?)
I've got a made up game for you but I don't have a name for it yet. Have you ever thought about those arbitrary measures of time that people use every day? For example ‘I’ll be back in a while.’ Well I've always wondered how long is a while which has led me to the creation of this game. Here's how you play, producer Dave will give you both the same three scenarios and you have to decide how long you think that particular measure of time is for example ‘you could be back in a while’ given the context you could guess that ‘a while’ is 30 minutes. You have to write your answer down so not swayed by each other's guesses. The closest person to the correct time (Dave’s scenario time) gets the point and the person with the most points at the end of the game wins.
