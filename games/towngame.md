# No name (Town game)
This made up game is born out of long car journeys and hatred of I Spy. The game can be played by two more players and the quizmaster. Itâ€™s suitable for anyone with a half decent knowledge of towns and cities. The original game involved in A-Z in the car, the modern version just requires a smart phone. How to play: the quizmaster pics any town or city in Great Britain, for example, somebody could say Huddersfield. Players they have to scribble down which town or city they think is the closest to Huddersfield Bradford or Wakefield for example. The quizmaster will then use a smartphone map to measure the distance between the chosen locations of the two guesses the shortest distance by car wins the point and the person with the most points after five rounds wins.
