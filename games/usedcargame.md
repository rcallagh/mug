# No name (Used Car Game)
 I came up with this game with my wife insisted we buy a very expensive toaster to which I pointed out that for that amount of money we can get a good quality secondhand Rover 75, although I would suspect it’s not officially resolved I think I delivered the winning blow when I mention that with the Rover we could make memories while with the toaster we could just make bread warm. That got me thinking ‘how much is the most expensive Rover 75 in the country?’ and the game was born. Here is how you play: an adjudicator goes onto the auto trader website and does a national search for for a used car it is no longer in production for example the Peugeot 106. Both players then have to guess the price of the U.K.'s most expensive Peugeot 106. At the moment there is one for sale for £999 43,000 miles on the clock. Good luck playing the game and I hope you enjoy it
