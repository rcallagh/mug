# Currency Bingo
You have 100 of any currency and you have to guess how much it would be in UK pounds sterling. It’s called currency bingo. The questionmaster will pick currencies and will say ‘I’ve come back from holiday and I have 100 e.g. Jordanian dinar I've got to travel agents and they offered me how much?’ The player that gets the closest amount wins and it’s the best of five.
