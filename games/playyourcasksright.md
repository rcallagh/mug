# Play your casks right 
It's called play your cast right yeah all you need this to willing participants and a quiz master who have googled on able to do a collection of beers and ales. Hereâ€™s how it works: toss a coin to decide who goes first. Dave then names an ale along with its alcoholic strength as a percentage. Player one then has to guess if the next is higher or lower than the previous. If you're correct you carry on, if you're wrong player two takes over and takes control of the run and the winner is the person who answers the last one correct.
