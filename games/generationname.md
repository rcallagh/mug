It works like this, the question master picks a year and finds a list of the top 20 male and female baby names from that year in the UK. The contestants each guess one male and one female name from that year which they think may have been in the top 20. If the name is guessed correctly from the list points are awarded in reverse order from 10 to 1 i.e. number one most popular get 10 points second most popular 9. The player with the most points after three rounds is the winner.
