# Rotten Tomatoes Game
I present to you the rotten tomatoes game, the game where an encyclopaedic knowledge of truly terrible films comes into its own. The rules: players - two or more . How to play: you pick a genre, the more obscure the better, then each player has to give the name of film they think has the lowest rotten tomatoes tomatomer score. The aim of the game as in that of the game show pointless,  you have to get close to 0 as he possibly can. Once you've said your film you have to stick with it. By all means throw in a sequel but you have to give the entire title e.g. American pie presents beta house.
