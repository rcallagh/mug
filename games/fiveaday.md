# Five a Day
Hi, we recently had a four hour delay flying home from Italy my wife and I decided to make up some games to pass the time. This was the game we enjoyed the most, it's called Five a Day the aim of the game is to guess how many of each fruit or vegetable you would need to eat for your one portion of your five a day. For example you need to eat seven strawberries for one portion of your five a day. For each item the contestant closest the correct answer wins the point and he's include a link ([I guess this](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/5-a-day-portion-sizes/)) from the NHS website which producer Dave can use.
