# How Many Walesâ€™?
A couple of weeks ago you mentioned that a quiz associated with Wales would be a good idea and might help Elis along with his winning streak, so I've come up with a quiz centred around Wales in the light of pretty much every random size comparison being made in terms of country/state/desert being X number of times bigger than Wales. So here's how to play: producer Dave picks five countries or places and you take it in turns to guess how many times bigger it is than Wales. For example the Sahara desert is how many times larger than Wales? answer: 400.
