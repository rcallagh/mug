# No name (Stadium game)
Here is my made up game, it's pretty simple. Producer Dave will pick venues of live music and sport from across the globe and then you will take it in turns to guess the capacity of the venue. For example, he could say Wembley Stadium and the correct answer would be 90,000. The person closest to the actual number wins the point it's best-of-seven good luck and I hope you enjoy the game.
