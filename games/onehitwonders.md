# One Hit Wonders
Here is my made up game it’s called one-hit wonders, but it’s not quite what you think. Here’s how to play: the questionmaster picks five artists who have had a one hit wonder i.e. one way the famous song but no other mainstream success. The question master then goes to Spotify and using the play count feature find out what the chosen artist’s second biggest song was. They then play a clip of said song to you and you have to try and guess the artist, for example Hanson, Mmbop can be considered a one hit wonder. If you play the second most played song, Save Me, can the players identified as Hanson? It's best-of-five, you need to write your answer down so you don't end up helping each other. Player with the most points at the end of the game wins good luck.
