# Scrabbled
I have a made up game for you created with my full-time GF on the tube platform, it’s called Scrabbled. Here’s how to play, producer Dave picks a page random from the official scrabble dictionary (other tile-based word play game lexicons are available) and reads out the first and last word on the page then you take it in turns to train name as many words as you can in 30 seconds that you think appear on that page. Variations on the same ward are acceptable so for example vibe vibes and vibing all count. Three rounds, highest cumulative score wins.
