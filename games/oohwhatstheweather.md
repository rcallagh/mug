# Ooh, What’s the weather?
I want to submit my game called oh what's the weather like, it was made of approximately seven years ago when I was waiting for my wife to give birth in Basingstoke hospital. Producer Dave day pics five cities from around the world and you both try and guess what the weather and the temperature currently is in that city. With temperature, you score a point for every degree you are away from the correct answer. For the type of weather, you’ll have a one point deducted if you’re able to nail the exact type of weather that the city is experiencing. Contestant with the lowest score over five rounds wins hope you have fun playing oh what’s the weather like
