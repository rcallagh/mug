## Welcome to Made Up Games

This site will hold an archive of all the made up games from the [Elis James and John Robins podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0005fdz/episodes/downloads). Currently working through the BBC podcast and adding the games from there.

If you want to really recreate the Made Up Games experience at home here's the [jingle](audio/jingle.mp3).

### Info
I extracted the rules for most of these games verbatim from the podcast using automated audio transcription software, with some manual editing for punctuation and clarity. That being said, some of the rules may be unclear so the best source is obviously just to listen to the podcast and hear the game being played.
